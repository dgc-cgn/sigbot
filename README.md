# What's the big deal?
Every website domain name that has been issued a TLS certificate, can sign any PDF document with the same public key of this TLS certificate. 

Anyone can verify the authenticity of the signed PDF by retrieving the public key of the website, just as they do now for a secure `https` connection.

No changes are required on the website!
